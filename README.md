> Welcome Neighbor is a web application that allows Users to connect to people in their Neighborhood on a more intimate level. Neighborhoods are defined as street blocks in order to allow Users to create a meaningful connection with Neighbors in close proximity. Users must create an account to access the full functionality of the application like viewing posts, creating posts, and pdf print Neighborhood contact information. Users have ability to browse existing Neighborhoods and then join appropriate Neighborhood. If a User does not see their Neighborhood in the list of available neighborhoods they have the option to create a Neighborhood under an Administrator account. Once signed up Users will have access to create posts and decide whether only those in their Neighborhood can view or make it viewable to Users in all neighborhoods.
